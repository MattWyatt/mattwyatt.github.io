			<h3>headmaster of the archives</h3>
			<p>    
				Yeah, I'm Matt, and these are the archives. This digital space is an ever-expanding library of my personal achievements, notes, and projects.

			<h3>inhabitants of the archives</h3>
			<p>
				Here, recorded in the space of these archives, are some of the projects I've worked on. This digital space was constructed as a home for them to inhabit, like personalities. When one is using a program, I believe that they must feel as if they are talking to the machine. This is why all the inhabitants of this library are given names and titles. Programs deserve humanity, and musn't be made to do inhumane tasks; naming software as such encourages us to treat it as such. This is my philosophy on software design.

			<h3>writings of a digital headmaster</h3>
			<p>
				Contained within these archives, as well, are my personal writings on various topics. Countless times have the writings of others helped me in solving a problem; I believe I should return the favor by publishing my writings within my library, for all to see.
