<h3>avant-garde post-bot</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://discordapp.com">discord</a> a lot. It's my primary method of communication for nearly all things online, and oftentimes conversations on other platforms will migrate to discord after some time. As a result, I've repeatedly tried my hand at making a bot utilizing the discord API. I think, that with sigur, I finally got it right this time. As for his name, Sigur himself is actually named after the experimental rock band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAwPeqrdAk">Sigur Ros</a></p>

<h3>mistress of infinite procedures</h3>

<p>Sybil is a process manager designed to run on linux-based systems. She is written entirely in C++. I had wanted to build an application of this type for a long time. When my local TSA (Technology Student Association) software development competition finally came around, I saw that as my opportunity to finally give life to Sybil.</p>
