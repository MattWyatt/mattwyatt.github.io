			<h3>a little bit about me</h3>
			<p>    
				Yeah, I'm Matt. These are the archives. This digital space is an ever-expanding library of my personal achievements, notes, and projects. I've been dabbling in programming for about seven years now. I primarily work in C++ and Python, but I've experience in C# and Javascript too!

			<h3>i make stuff sometimes</h3>

				Here, recorded in this space that I like to call the archives, are the projects I've worked on. Not all of the things I've done are going to be listed here on this website. You'll find everything else on my <a href="https://github.com/MattWyatt">Github page</a>.
				I tend to name my large projects with actual names that I like, because I believe it gives the program a better feel about it. They're not code-names or anything like that, just stylistic monikers.

			<h3>my personal blog</h3>
			<p>
				Contained within these archives, as well, are my personal writings on various topics. Countless times have the writings of others helped me in solving a problem; I believe I should return the favor by publishing my writings within my library, for all to see.
