<h3>crystalization of an aesthetic</h3>

<p>Right, this diary thing. First article. This article likely won't be all that great, nor coherent. I expect to get better at this, however. Anyway, here we go. For a very long time now, I've been wanting to turn my vague idea of an aesthetic into a real and visible thing. When I began work on this site, I wanted it to look <em>exactly</em> like what I had imagined. An understandable goal. However, when I began to write the stylesheets for the site, I noticed that I really didn't have a clear idea of just what this design was; it was only a vague concept in my head. This was the first challenge.</p>

<h2>the aesthetic</h2>

<p>When I began to write the site, I knew that I wanted black lines, or something similar, in the background. I wanted to achieve, not a sketched look, but a sketched <em>feel</em>. To achieve this, I use a javascript library called <a href="https://roughjs.com/">rough.js.</a> Rough is wonderful, really; it's the most important part of the atmosphere of the site. After writing the script to draw random lines all over the place, I found the site still lacking. I wanted stars. I draw stars all over the place, when it comes to paper; there is no reason that they shouldn't be all over my website.</p>

<h2>drawing stars</h2>

<p>Unlike the line-drawing function. The star-drawing function was going to be much more difficult to work out. Lines have two points, so I could generate two random numbers on opposite ends of the page, and draw. Stars don't just have two points though, they have <em>five</em>. Writing something that generated five different points in proximity enough to make a star was out of the question. I settled for SVGs. The star drawing script actually uses pre-defined SVG paths for the stars; the SVGs were drawn with <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> and then copied. I wrote a script that took the SVG paths, and used Rough to draw them; however, it drew all of them in the same place. Rough had no way to translate SVG paths by default, and so it drew them all at <code>(0,0)</code>. A bit of research showed that SVG DOM elements had a "translate" attribute. Bingo. After modifying the script to generate random numbers for the "translate" parameters, I was drawing cute little stars all over my site.</p>

<h2>content</h2>

<p>I spent a great deal of time making the background-generation for this site perfect. During that time, however, I happened to forget that I needed to display page content. While developing the background, my previously-vague idea of an aesthetic had begun to solidify into a set of rules. (two to be exact)</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything must be black and white</li>
<li>Everything must vaguely remind the viewer of a handwritten letter</li>
</ul>

<p>A peculiar set of rules, for sure, but a set of rules nonetheless. To meet my first requirement, I selected two colors: <code>#000000</code> and <code>#fdfdfd</code>. To meet my second requirement, I settled on a CSS class that would have a header, a subheader, and a body, just like a letter. After applying a drop shadow on all sides, the site looked perfect.</p>
