			<h3>headmaster of the archives</h3>
			<p>    
				Yeah, I'm Matt, and these are the archives. This digital space is an ever-expanding library of my personal achievements, notes, and projects.

			<h3>inhabitants of the archives</h3>
			<p>
				Here, recorded in the space of these archives, are some of the projects I've worked on. This digital space was created in hopes of giving life to these projects; that's why they all have names. All software can be defined as an interface: human to machine. That interface, however, being developed by humans, opens itself to inheriting little bits and pieces of our humanity and our names. A program with a recognizable name feels much nicer than a program with a cold and functional name. When using software, one must feel as if they are talking to a computer, not using it. This is my philosophy on software design.

			<h3>writings of a digital headmaster</h3>
			<p>
				Contained within these archives, as well, are my personal writings on various topics. Countless times have the writings of others helped me in solving a problem; I believe I should return the favor by publishing my writings within my library, for all to see.
